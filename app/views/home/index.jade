    p Sorry, Data. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. They were just sucked into space. Damage report! Not if I weaken first. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, lights up! Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. You enjoyed that. Wouldn't that bring about chaos?
    p Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. We have a saboteur aboard. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Your head is not an artifact! The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Well, that's certainly good to know. Your shields were failing, sir.
    p Damage report! Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. What? We're not at all alike! And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. How long can two people talk about nothing? My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant?
